        <p>In 1997, I started my academic career at the University of Memphis, TN as an undergrad. Before that, I had never used a computer; I didn't even know where the on button was. That year, something magical happened, I discovered the internet. I was in complete awe of technology and wanted that to be my career. I remember how invisible I felt when I made my first online purchase in 1998, a pair of J. Crew boots.</p>
<p>I changed my major from Accounting to Computer Science. I took programming classes, data structures, operating systems, assembly language and so on. Things didn't come alive for me until I took a class called "Expert Systems," an artificial intelligence (AI) class. I took that class in the spring of 2000. I can honestly say that class molded the entirety of my career. I wrote Prolog code and loved it. Declarative logic was bae. I still have my textbook and notes from that class. I fell so hard for AI that I went to work at a startup which built online learning platform powered by a naive auto-tutor. We were ahead of our time. The company went belly up during the dot-com boom. I was a junior dev and did QA. I could see the writing on the wall and decided to head back to grad school to spend more time digging deeper into AI I spent the early 2000s coding neural nets, studying control of autonomous agents, deductive databases and so on. By far Stan Franklin's Control of Autonomous Agents was my favorite class.</p>
<p>In the end, I settled on research that focused on using the Semantic Web to build sensor Ontologies. I did this work under the tutelage of Dr. David Russomanno, the now dean of engineering at IUPUI (Indiana University â€“ Purdue University Indianapolis). Our paper "Building a Sensor Ontology: A Practical Approach Leveraging ISO and OGC Models" made a significant dent. Because of all my work in reasoning, I started daydreaming about building a system that could decode rap lyrics. Jay-Z and Beyonce's 03 Bonnie and Clyde became a particular fixation. I wanted to build an engine that could decode it. A year or two later my son was born, and I took four years parental leave.</p>
<p>In those four years, it became apparent to me that I wanted to study the other side of computational intelligence. I saw computational intelligence from a higher order perspective, something that is independent of the embodied substrate. I had spent a decade studying computational intelligence in an artificial substrate. Now I wanted to study it in humans; mainly I wanted to know how people interact with computation. This quest led me to UC Berkeley for a Ph.D. in Computer Science Ed. I focused on beginners like I was in 1997. Through research, I learned that the challenge was more social than cognitive. In the near future, I look forward to using this knowledge and this journey to help others learn computation faster. </p>
